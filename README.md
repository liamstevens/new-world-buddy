# new-world-buddy
## Purpose
This tool is designed to provide opinionated advice on optimised pathways to take in order to level crafting professions in New World. 
##Contents
This repository contains the logic that drives the decision making process (currently in Python) as well as the infrastructure definition in Terraform. There will be more languages and frameworks added to this as the tool matures and reaches the level where having a web front-end, etc. is appropriate.
##Usage
The tool will be hosted at a URL as yet undefined. Should you wish to deploy your own version of the tool for some reason, there will be bootstrap scripts to begin the containerisation and deployment process uploaded here in the future.
