# new-world-buddy
## Purpose
This tool is designed to provide opinionated advice on optimised pathways to take in order to level crafting professions in New World. 
## Contents
This repository contains the logic that drives the decision making process (currently in Python) as well as the infrastructure definition in Terraform. There will be more languages and frameworks added to this as the tool matures and reaches the level where having a web front-end, etc. is appropriate.
## Usage
The tool was intended to be hosted at a web endpoint, but this has since shifted into a Discord bot. This also marks the pivot of the tool to a more general purpose API + interface via Discord.
